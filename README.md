# Employee Management System for Syracuse University

This project focuses on designing a database for the Syracuse University Food Services to automate the employee work scheduling. This Project was a part of my IST659 - Database Management System Course at Syracuse University.

## Motivation
Currently, SU Food Service offers many services on campus for students and staff of Syracuse University. I am primarily focusing on solving the problems of dining halls which are across every corner of the campus. Student employees and commercial workers have different shifts that they need to be picked up according to their schedule. Thus, there is an absence of a system where these students have to physically be present to pick these shifts up. Moreover, every time a student wants to sub or pick a shift he has to mail the SU Food Service Management. Thus, everything is manual and there is no level of customization to this data.For this, we need to develop a database application that will change the process of sub shifts. Through this application, the student employees who are willing to drop their shift can upload their shift details and reason on the application which can be accessed by management and student employees. As a result, this will eliminate the huge number of emails that all student employees receive. So, if a student wants a sub shift he can directly login to the application and see what shifts are available. This will eliminate the cumbersome of sub shift mails that popup on students mail ids.
